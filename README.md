# Machine-Learning---Cancer-Risk-Clasification
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model for the early prediction of lung cancer using a comprehensive dataset. Lung cancer is a significant health concern, and early detection
plays a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes and reducing mortality rates. By analyzing an extensive dataset comprising patient records, this project utilizes machine learning techniques
to accurately predict lung cancer risk factors. The developed models offer a quick and efficient method for computing the probability of lung cancer, enabling timely interventions and
personalized healthcare. The findings from this project have the potential to assist medical professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and implementing targeted prevention and
treatment strategies. The success of this project demonstrates the promising application of machine learning such as multinomial logistic regression and decision tree analysis in improving
lung cancer prediction and ultimately contributing to better patient care.


Early prediction of lung cancer is crucial for improving treatment outcomes and reducing mortality rates. However, existing methods often require costly hospital tests and extensive data
input, making them inaccessible and time-consuming. The tool utilizes machine learning techniques and analyzes a dataset of 1000 patient records to compute the risk factors associated
with lung cancer. The objective is to provide an accurate and efficient method for computing the risk factors, enabling individuals who lack access to costly tests to obtain their lung cancer risk
assessment quickly. The report concludes with an analysis of the tool's predictions and its supposed applications/recommendations
